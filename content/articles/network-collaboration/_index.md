This article is part of a series documenting the development of a framework powering collaborative editing experiences where networked clients control a shared state on the server. It is based on open source work done as part of the [Metalab](https://sat.qc.ca/recherche/metalab) team of the [Société des Arts Technologiques](https://sat.qc.ca) from 2017 to 2018. The source code is still evolving today and is available on the [Metalab's Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/sat-metalab/py-satnet).
